# Large dataset

We include in this directory a large dataset sampling: 

- The events simulated (MadGraph+Pythia+Delphes) 
- The notebook to run with 3250 events and 10% of signal (you need to save the 'plotting\_customized.py' file into your system libraries)
- The results of the run (i.e. the plots)

You can just see the plots that are the results, or you can try the notebook and run it by yourself.

## The Physics

This larger data set was created to see the evolution of the paper figure with more accumulated statistic.  We see that there are slight improvements in the $\sigma$ s, but slightly worse in the fraction \pi_S.  Therefore we conclude that multiplying the statistics x3 is not enough.

In the paper Appendix we show that the problem is that the true values for the $m_{bb}$ width (15 GeV) is too large in comparison with the $m_{bb}$ allowed range that goes from 100 to 140 GeV.  In the appendix we reduce the width, and some other adjustments, and with just 500 events we obtain a very good posterior.
