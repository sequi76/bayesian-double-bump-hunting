# Sampling with Dynesty

- This directory contains the notebook to run Dynesty with the model in the paper and with the data already generated.  

- You can start from here, since the notebook imports the generated data from the other directory (maintain the directory structure from the repo!)

- One more thing: the file "plotting_customized.py" should be put in the same direrctory as Dynesty.  This file is an adaptation of the plotting module in Dynesty, just customized to plot the plots in the paper.
